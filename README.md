# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

Tracks user spending amounts based on transaction
Keep track of the number of subscription services such as Netflix and Spotify the user’s spends per monthly(data aggregation)
Show what the user’s monthly subscription that they pay for(some incidents happens and consumers don’t even know if they are paying for a monthly subscription and this helps with that issue)
Put into an array of everything from month to month
Keep track of the amount the user spends for a full financial tracking experience, so users can see what they have been spending their money on (example if they spend an X amount on restaurants or Amazon)
User has the option to set their budget based on percentage of their salary or just how much they want to spend per month(just tracking, not actual restriction if they use their cards(maybe in the future))
Have a sandbox feature that helps manage the user’s budget, example if they want to spend money on a new shoe, how will that look like in their budget
Use Charts.js to make a chart to show user how their budget is being spent based on array
